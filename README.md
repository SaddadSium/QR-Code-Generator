QR Code Generator

Overview
This project is a simple web application that generates QR codes based on user input (text or URL). The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the QRCode.js library to create QR codes dynamically. The generated QR code is displayed in a visually appealing container with a smooth transition effect.

Features

•	Input field for users to enter text or a URL.
•	Button to trigger QR code generation.
•	Displays the generated QR code with a smooth transition effect.
•	Responsive design with a clean and modern UI.
•	Error handling with a shake animation for invalid inputs.

Files

•	index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web application.
•	style.css: The CSS file for styling the application, including layout, colors, and animations.
•	script.js (not provided but referenced): The JavaScript file that handles QR code generation using the QRCode.js library.
•	QRCode.js: External library used for generating QR codes (included via CDN in index.html).

Setup and Installation

1.	Clone or Download the Project:
•	Download the project files or clone the repository to your local machine.

2.	File Structure:
•	Ensure index.html, style.css, and script.js are in the same directory.
•	The QRCode.js library is included via a CDN, so no local copy is required.

3.	Run the Application:
•	Open index.html in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
•	No additional server setup is required since the application runs entirely on the client side.

Dependencies

•	An internet connection is required to load the QRCode.js library from the CDN (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/qrcodejs/1.0.0/qrcode.min.js).
•	Ensure the script.js file (not provided) includes the logic to handle QR code generation using the QRCode.js library.

Usage

•	Open the application in a web browser.
•	Enter a valid text or URL in the input field.
•	Click the "Generate QR Code" button.
•	The QR code will appear below the button with a smooth transition effect.
•	If the input is invalid (e.g., empty), an error animation (shake effect) will be triggered.

Styling

•	The application uses the Poppins font for a modern look.
•	The container is centered on the page with a green background (#6ebfab) and rounded corners.
•	The input field and button are styled for a clean and user-friendly experience.
•	The QR code image is displayed in a box with a transition effect for smooth appearance.
•	An error animation (shake) is applied to the input field for invalid inputs.

Customization

•	To customize the application, you can:
•	Modify style.css to change colors, fonts, or layout.
•	Update the container width or padding for different screen sizes.
•	Adjust the transition duration or animation keyframes in style.css.
•	Enhance script.js to add more features, such as downloading the QR code or validating specific URL formats.

Notes

•	Ensure the script.js file contains the necessary logic to interact with the QRCode.js library and handle input validation.
•	The application assumes an internet connection for loading the QRCode.js library.
•	For offline use, download the QRCode.js library and include it locally in the project.
